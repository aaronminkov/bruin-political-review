                                            Since the beginning of the United States’ intervention in the Middle East, countries around the world have looked to our
                                            involvement as an example of the dangers of overextending resources and lack of planning. Following the September 11th
                                            attacks in 2001 the United States military intervened in Afghanistan in order to drive the Taliban from power, and then
                                            in 2003 invaded Iraq to overthrow Suddam Hussein’s regime. These decisions inserted the United States military into the
                                            Middle East for the next two decades, with little reason to believe there will soon be a dramatic scaling back of
                                            involvement. In what have been dubbed ‘endless wars’, the United States was dragged into conflict in which there were no
                                            clear exit strategies, with regional developments further entrenching our involvement. At a certain point the initial
                                            strategies in which the U.S. entered with evolved as the situation also evolved.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>   
                                            The geopolitical jigsaw puzzle across the Middle East is anchored by two rivaling powers: Iran and Saudi Arabia. The
                                            United States has sided itself with Saudi Arabia and its allies in its effort to restrict Iran’s regional influence.
                                            Iran’s utilization of proxy groups and links to terrorism have further motivated the United States’ dealings with Iran.
                                            The strategy for these dealings underwent a dramatic shift when in 2016 Donald Trump was elected as President. President
                                            Trump diverged from the overall strategy set by President George W. Bush and continued by President Barack Obama. Trump
                                            quickly left the Iran Nuclear Deal orchestrated by Obama and warmed to Saudi rulers. His administration also influenced
                                            the normalization of relations between Israel and multiple of its regional adversaries like Bahrain and the United Arab
                                            Emirates. Critics have expressed displeasure regarding Trump’s relationship with Saudi Arabia given their human rights
                                            violations, however any chance of finding some form of success in the politically fractured region requires choosing
                                            which issues to prioritize for the sake of securing the homeland and America’s interests. While the new realist approach
                                            by the United States has the opportunity for success, it’s flawed execution has hurt our overall standing in the region.

                                            When European world powers finally ended the destruction of the Second World War, colonizing countries like Britain,
                                            France and Italy faced financial ruin, and were forced to withdraw from the region. The plans they enacted to transfer
                                            power to the local populations were often rushed and ill-conceived.<sup>1</sup> Competing nationalisms that formed in the region led
                                            to battles for power, including the repeating Arab-Israeli wars. The discovery of massive amounts of oil in the region,
                                            just as the global economy began relying on the energy source, made the land, and the regimes that controlled them, of
                                            international interest. Saudi Arabia today is the largest exporter of crude oil in the world, and five of the top ten
                                            largest exporters are in the region. As economies modernized and grew, access and control over oil fields became
                                            increasingly important. International focus on the region gradually grew and Middle Eastern countries developed
                                            rivalries largely on religious lines.

                                            The two most influential countries include the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with a Sunni Muslim majority, and Iran, with a
                                            Shiite Muslim majority. Both of these countries have used this power interacting with their neighbors in different ways
                                            with two major alliances roughly formed. Saudi Arabia is the most powerful member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, with
                                            the UAE, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait also being member states. The United States, including its NATO allies have
                                            traditionally been more supportive of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) than the council’s adversaries.

                                            Iran, on the other hand, has relied more heavily on proxy groups to do their bidding in the region. More recently, the
                                            Iranian regime has relied on the power vacuums that emerged following the Arab Spring in 2011 to utilize their proxy
                                            groups and gain influence. This has occurred in countries like Iraq, Syria and Yemen.<sup>2</sup> Iran uses its controversial
                                            Revolutionary Guard Quds Force to organize, train and supply groups vying for power in other countries. Many of these
                                            groups have been designated as terrorist organizations, leading to Iran’s characterization by the western powers as the
                                            world’s leading state-sponsor of terrorism.<sup>3</sup> While most of the United States’ focus in the region is fighting many of
                                            these groups, the underlying objective is to limit the strength and influence of the Iranian regime.

                                            The central diplomatic strategy pursued by the Obama administration revolved around the Joint Comprehensive Plan of
                                            Action (JCPOA), or the Iran Nuclear Deal, that was created in 2015 and became effective October of that year. The JCPOA
                                            was a continuation of previous agreements in which Iran restricted its Nuclear program in exchange for relief of
                                            sanctions. The Iran Nuclear Deal that President Obama’s administration finalized in 2015 drastically reduced Iran’s
                                            uranium stockpile for 15 years, forced Iran to store a majority of its centrifuges for a period of 10 years, limited
                                            their nuclear research program, and created an inspection system to ensure Iran’s compliance with the agreement.<sup>4</sup> Some
                                            critics were dubious of its effectiveness both at home and abroad. Israel, a neighboring country, was one country that
                                            opposed the agreement, and many conservative lawmakers in the United States echoed their concerns. Polling in Israel
                                            from 2015 found that 70% of Israeli’s opposed the Iran Nuclear Deal with only 10% supporting it and an identical
                                            percentage believing they could trust the United States to “thwart Tehran’s ambitions to produce unconventional arms.”<sup>5</sup>
                                            Domestically, GOP lawmakers criticized the agreement for being weak on Iran and it would eventually become a large
                                            component of the 2016 presidential campaigns.

                                            During President Obama’s term, the United States’ position in the middle east appeared to weaken due to inconsistent
                                            military intervention. First, in regards to Iran, facing the fallout of the Arab Spring of 2011, in which large scale
                                            pro-democracy protests collapsed authoritarian regimes, Obama decided to intervene in the Libyan Civil War, but not to
                                            intervene in the Syrian Civil War. One of the main groups involved in the Syrian conflict is Hezbollah, a lebonese group
                                            known for being militants in a range of conflicts from Lebanon to Israel to Bosnia. The group has had intimate ties to
                                            the Iranian regime since its founding, being heavily influenced by the Iranian Revolution in 1979, and the group follows
                                            the “theological and sometimes ideological guidance of Iran’s supreme leader…”<sup>6</sup>, especially the military wing of the
                                            organization. In 2019, the Treasury Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing Marshall Billingslea assessed Iran’s
                                            monetary contribution to the group at $700 million a year at one point, though sanctions against Iran have reduced that
                                            number recently.<sup>7</sup> Despite Barack Obama’s declaration in 2011 that Bashar al-Assad should step aside, the administration
                                            decided not to use the U.S. military to intervene (drone use? Organizational help? More research needed). The Obama
                                            administration ultimately decided that the United States’ strategic interests were not inherently tied to Syria and,
                                            further, that Syria’s minor role in the United States’ economy made the potential consequences outweigh the benefits of
                                            intervention.<sup>8</sup> Large scale intervention by Iran in the conflict in 2013 led Steven Heydemann of the Center for Middle
                                            East Policy at The Brookings Institution to wonder “Is it a matter of interest to the United States whether Iran
                                            consolidates its position as a regional hegemon in the Arab East?”<sup>9</sup> With the United States not intervening in Syria,
                                            Bashar al-Assad’s regime received the advantage of support from the pro-Ba’ath Hezbollah, strengthening the Assad
                                            family’s control in the country. The absence of the United States in the Syrian conflict led to countries like Iran and
                                            Russia taking leading roles in the conflict, effectively weakening our diplomatic influence in the region.

                                        <p>
                                            The United States’ position in the region in regards to Syria was also weakened by conflict within the GCC. The crown
                                            prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad Bin Salmon, faced scrutiny from the international community over human rights
                                            violations, which stressed the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia. International criticism was not
                                            reduced after President Trump took office in 2017, as the kingdom was reprimanded for the murder and dismemberment of
                                            Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi Washington Post correspondent with close ties to the United States.<sup>10</sup> Saudi Arabia also
                                            coordinated a blockade against Qatar and escalated attacks against civilians in the Yemeni Civil War. Their aggressive
                                            attacks against Yemeni seperatist forces has led to more than three million people becoming internally displaced, and
                                            the outbreak of disease and famine, and the United Nations declaring the humanitarian crisis “the worst in the world.”<sup>11</sup>
                                            In response to an emboldened Saudi Arabia, the Trump administration has taken a significantly different approach than
                                            the two previous administrations; negligence, albeit negligence in exchange for a more powerful standing in the region.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The Trump administration’s approach to policy with Saudi Arabia is a prime example of how negligence is being used to
                                            limit the power of Iran and promote the United States’ interests in the region. The main opposition group to the Yemeni
                                            government is the Houthi rebels, a Shiite group with ties to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah.
                                            Despite a lack of historical ties between the two countries, Iran capitalized on the civil unrest in Yemen during the
                                            Arab Spring in 2011 and began supplying the Houthis with rockets, missiles, rocket-propelled grenades, explosives and
                                            ammunition. The United States also found that Iran’s Revolutionary Guard was providing training and assistance to the
                                            rebel group in northern Syria. Iranian support of the Houthis continued to grow as the group began achieving military
                                            success. In 2014, after the Houthis had captured the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, Houthi leaders travelled to Tehran and set
                                            up agreements to resume air service between Tehran and Sanaa, as well as pledges to increase Yemeni-Iranian cooperation.<sup>12</sup>
                                            Recently, the Houthis began attacking Saudi targets in addition to continued strikes against the Yemeni government. The
                                            conflict is perpetuated by the fact that outside interests lay at the heart of the civil war. Iran sees the potential
                                            for increased influence in the region by helping the Iranian-tied Houthis gain power, and the Saudis would not allow
                                            their southern border to be placed under the influence of Iran. Despite the abhorrent and worsening crisis in Yemen, the
                                            United States has kept its close ties with the regional power. The Trump administration sees the threat of expanded
                                            Iranian influence, particularly so close to Saudi Arabia, and has decided not to punish Saudi Arabia for targeting
                                            civilians and the infrastructure of the already impoverished Yemen. In fact, in 2019 the United States Secretary of
                                            State Mike Pompeo used an emergency waiver to avoid facing congressional oversight in the sale of billions of dollars
                                            worth of weapons to the Saudi kingdom, many of these weapons likely to be used against civilians.<sup>13</sup> Pompeo validated the
                                            emergency measure by referring to “Iranian aggression” and the volatility of the region.<sup>14</sup> This action by the Trump
                                            administration demonstrates different priorities than his two predecessors. While Bush and Obama were motivated, at
                                            least in part, by support for democratic reforms in the region as well as protecting United States interests, the Trump
                                            administration seems much more influenced by the latter.

                                            President Trump’s administration, on top of reimposing sanctions and withdrawing from the JCPOA, took major steps to
                                            escalate military tensions with Iran. In January of 2020 President Trump ordered a drone strike assassinating Iranian
                                            general Qasem Soleimani, commander of the aforementioned Quds force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Soleimani was
                                            considered one of the most powerful figures in the Iranian regime and his death sent shockwaves through the region and
                                            the world. His critics quickly pointed out the likely absence of both international and domestic legal authority, lack
                                            of statutory authority without approval from Congress, and high potential for significant military escalation. It is
                                            worth noting that both the Obama and Bush administrations had similar opportunities and ultimately did not execute a
                                            strike for fear of retaliation against the over 5,000 American soldiers in neighboring Iraq and around the region.<sup>15</sup> The
                                            already tense alliance between Iraq, Iran and the United States, combined with the popularity of Soleimani and lack of
                                            control over these militias in the country by the Iraqi government created the huge potential for violent backlash
                                            against United States soldiers positioned in Iraq. In addition to the threat against United States Soldiers, the United
                                            States’ wounded its reputation and influence in Iraq, and therefore the region. The General’s popularity among the local
                                            population prompted quick backlash from the Iraqi parliament, who issued a resolution urging Iraqi Prime Minister to
                                            rescind Iraq’s invitation to U.S. troops.<sup>16</sup> President Trump further exacerbated tensions by threatening the bombing of
                                            Iranian cultural sites via tweet if tensions between the two countries did not settle,<sup>17</sup> repeating the claim the next day
                                            to reporters on Air Force One.<sup>18</sup> The United States military ultimately faced several attacks with no reported casualties,
                                            however the threat of escalating retaliation or increased radicalization remains ongoing. If the strike against
                                            Soleimani had been executed in less careless of a manner, the decision makes sense given the overall strategy in the
                                            region. With more protection in place for retaliatory attacks against soldiers on the ground, coordination with
                                            Congress, and in a way that didn’t weaken our relationship with the government of Iraq, this strike would have been able
                                            to simultaneously eliminate a perpetrator of terrorism and send a strong rebuff against a pattern of provocations by the
                                            Iranian regime. This strong message against Iran, and more specifically General Soleimani, makes sense when viewing the
                                            decision through the perspective of the Middle East as a larger threat for a war against the Iranian proxy groups meant
                                            to consolidate Iranian control throughout the region. While wars in Iraq, Syria and Yemen are fought outside of Iran,
                                            they are often fought against groups that are not formally incorporated as Iranian forces, but are trained, supplied,
                                            and organized by the Iranian regime. While conflicts in the region that the United States is involved in are not against
                                            any official part of Iranian military, the Iranian military, specifically the leader of the Quds force, is involved in
                                            coordinating those that are at war with the United States military.

                                            Strong rebuffications by the United States are not enough in and of itself to restrict Iran’s influence in attempts to
                                            quell Iran-sponsored conflict. A strong competing coalition is necessary to secure the United States’ economic and
                                            military security in the region. This requires the United States to not only refortify the GCC but also expand it to
                                            include more countries in the region and promote economic growth. In the case of strengthening the coalition between
                                            Saudi-allied countries, President Trump has been unsuccessful and even counterproductive. However, in the goal of
                                            increasing the number of countries in the region aligned with U.S. allies, the President has been somewhat successful.
                                            An example of formal expansion of relations with a U.S. ally can be seen in the United States’ closest ally in the
                                            region and most militarily capable in the Middle East: Israel. Long burdened with regional animosity leading to large
                                            scale conflict with neighbors, Israel has long been considered by the western alliance as a testament to the ideals they
                                            hope to spread in the region. Nancy Pelosi, at a 2012 AIPAC conference, made the analogy that “Israel and the Jewish
                                            people remain a symbol of democracy…,”<sup>19</sup> stressing the United States’ long and continued partnership with the nation in a
                                            hostile region. For decades, Israel has maintained full diplomatic relations with only two neighbors in Egypt and
                                            Jordan, when the countries signed peace treaties in the late 20th century.<sup>20</sup> Recently, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain
                                            and Israel signed agreements to normalize relations and establish diplomatic ties.<sup>21</sup> Another optimistic development for
                                            this strategy was lack of opposition from Saudi Arabia, with Prince Faisal bin Farhan saying the agreements “could be
                                            viewed as positive.”<sup>22</sup> The move was to the dismay of Palestinian organizations, as the Palestinian nation was the subject
                                            of most of the controversy,<sup>23</sup> however it does serve the administrations objective to expand our network of relations in
                                            competition with Iran’s, strengthening our standing in the Middle East.

                                            On the other hand, President Trump has both witnessed and worsened the relationships between countries in the GCC. Qatar
                                            has maintained relations with organizations across the ideological spectrum of the region, including America, Iran,
                                            Hezbollah, and Hamas. In 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt imposed the “land, air, and sea blockade” and
                                            “issued a list of demands that would impair the sovereignty and independence of Qatar.”<sup>24</sup> They justified the blockade by
                                            accusing Qatar of sponsoring terrorism, which the U.S. had previously acknowledged, especially in regards to Hamas.<sup>25</sup> A
                                            subsequent story by the Washington Post found that U.S. intelligence agencies confirmed that UAE officials had plans to
                                            hack news sites owned and operated by the Qatari government to attribute false quotes to Qatar’s emir, the same quotes
                                            that the UAE used in their justification of the blockade.<sup>26</sup> It is also worth noting Qatar’s neighboring status with Iran,
                                            as well as their economic codependence in the energy industry. This link between Iran and Qatar makes the move more
                                            likely to be motivated by efforts to push back against an emboldened Iran, rather than Qatar’s reputation for harboring
                                            and funding terrorist groups. Despite an opportunity to use the United States’ capacity as a mediator to mend the GCC’s
                                            fractures while using the existing regional pressure against Qatar to force concessions on their terror-linked
                                            relations, the President supported the action. The day after the blockade began, President Trump tweeted his reiteration
                                            against the funding of radical ideology, adding “Leaders pointed to Qatar - Look!”<sup>27</sup> Despite further cracking down on
                                            terror-linked activities in Qatar, the move also risks pushing Qatar further from the GCC and America’s friends in the
                                            region, and therefore towards the influence of Iran’s own terror-linked regime.

                                            The most marked shift in long term strategy that has emerged in the Trump presidency is the shift away from caution to
                                            humanitarian virtues and stated objectives in spreading democracy. A greater emphasis has been placed on securing
                                            American interests at the expense of those stated virtues and goals. If that strategy is implemented, then it is
                                            imperative that our actions are calculated to increase our reputation and influence in the region in order to isolate
                                            Iran. While the plan appears to show the promise of a calculated realist approach in the region, it has been
                                            continuously impeded and jeopardized by some of Donald Trump’s impulsive decisions. After withdrawing from the Iran
                                            Nuclear Deal to take a more hardline approach in Iran’s dealings, and turning a blind eye to human rights violations in
                                            Saudi Arabia in commitment to that plan, the President often takes one step forward and two steps back in the pursuit of
                                            his objectives, hurting our international reputation more than helping our strategic objectives.
